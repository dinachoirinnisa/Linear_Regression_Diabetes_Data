# Linear_Regression_Diabetes_Data
The dataset came from 442 diabetic patients. There are 11 features such as age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements. 
I'm using data from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#wine-recognition-dataset

**Features in the dataset:**
* Age in years
* Sex
* BMI Body Mass Index
* bp average blood pressure
* S1 TC, Total Serum Cholesterol
* S2 LDL, low-density lipoproteins
* S3 HDL, High-Density Lipoproteins
* S4 tch, total cholesterol / HDL
* S5 LTG, possibly log of serum triglycerides level
* S6 Glu, Blood Sugar Level
* Y is quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline

**Purpose:**
1. Data exploration analysis
2. Knowing the factors of diabetes development
3. Testing the linear regression algorithm

**Insight:**
1. Diabetes can be caused by high body fat or triglycerides in the body.
2. Mean Absolute Error value of 50% on BMI, it is possible that the BMI value is able to affect diabetes in humans
3. Research on this dataset must be further developed using other algorithms.
